        I have been working in PrivatBank for more than 6 years, working in
        different departments, the idea that I want to become a Front-end
        developer never left me, from time to time I returned to self-study, but
        I faced difficulties and looked for reasons to quit this business, but
        last year I I decided that I want to achieve my goal, and enrolled in
        the SkillUp school for a front-end course, on this course I finally
        realized that this is what I want to do, I got a lot of new knowledge
        that I canâ€™t wait to put into practice.
